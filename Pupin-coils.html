<h1>Pupin coils</h1>
<img src="pupin-1916.jpg" alt="Pupin 1916">
<p><b>Pupin's 1899</b> patent for loading coils, archaically called <b> "Pupin coils" </b>, followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician <b>Oliver Heaviside</b>, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by <i>American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T) </i>, making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by <b>George Campbell</b> and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
